{"name":"PyInventor","tagline":"3D Graphics in Python with Open Inventor","body":"PyInventor provides a Python binding for the Open Inventor 3D graphics toolkit. The main drivers for this project are:\r\n- Enable the creation, modification and viewing of scene graphs with Python\r\n- Offer a flexible yet easy to use \"Python-like\" interface to Open Inventor\r\n- Support of Open Inventor extensions without introducing compile time dependencies\r\n- Platform independent and compatible with all major implementations ([Coin3D](https://bitbucket.org/Coin3D/coin/wiki/Home), [SGI](http://oss.sgi.com/projects/inventor/) and [VSG](http://www.vsg3d.com/open-inventor/sdk))\r\n- Undemanding maintenance of the library\r\n- Compatible with Python 3\r\n\r\n## Using the Module\r\nThis module provides capabilities to work with Inventor scene objects from Python. For an overview on how to use it please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/TheHubbit/PyInventor/wiki) where you can find a [getting started guide](https://github.com/TheHubbit/PyInventor/wiki/Using-PyInventor) and [examples](https://github.com/TheHubbit/PyInventor/wiki/PyInventor-Examples).\r\n\r\n![Preview](images/PyInventorExamples.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nThe documentation for all classes, functions and data can be viewed with *pydoc* or the [online help](man/PyInventor.html).\r\n\r\n## Scene Graph Editor\r\nThe included Scene Graph Editor application can render scene graph files (Inventor or VRML) and their structure in a tree view. It furthermore allows adding, removing or rearranging nodes within the scene graph as well as editing of field values, immediately making those changes visible in the viewport.\r\n\r\nTo run the editor simply type the following command.\r\n```\r\npython -m PyInventor\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Scene Graph Editor](images/SceneGraphEditor.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\nPyInventor is distributed under the BSD 3-Clause License. For full terms see the included COPYING file.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nThe software can be compiled and installed from source using included *distutils* setup script. CPython 3.x, numpy and Open Inventor are required on the target system. Before performing the setup, some variables that point to the Inventor include and library paths as well as the library names may have to be adjusted.\r\n```\r\n# Open Inventor paths and libraries:\r\noivincpath = ''\r\noivlibpath = ''\r\noivlibs = []\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfterwards calling the following command will first compile PyInventor and then copy the binaries into the site-packages directory.\r\n```\r\npython setup.py install\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
