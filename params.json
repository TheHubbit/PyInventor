{"name":"PyInventor","tagline":"3D Graphics in Python with Open Inventor","body":"PyInventor provides a Python binding for the [Open Inventor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Inventor) 3D graphics toolkit, which is an object oriented, high level programming layer for [OpenGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL). The Open Inventor toolkit is considerably easier to learn and use than OpenGL, hence the motto \"3D programming for humans\".\r\n\r\nThe main goals for the Python integration project are:\r\n- Enable the creation, modification and viewing of scene graphs in Python\r\n- Offer a flexible yet easy to use \"Python-like\" interface to Open Inventor\r\n- Support of Open Inventor extensions without introducing compile time dependencies\r\n- Platform independent and compatible with all major implementations ([Coin3D](https://bitbucket.org/Coin3D/coin/wiki/Home), [SGI](http://oss.sgi.com/projects/inventor/) and [VSG](http://www.vsg3d.com/open-inventor/sdk))\r\n- Undemanding maintenance of the library\r\n- Compatible with Python 3\r\n- Provide useful tools for 3D graphics programming such as a scene graph editor\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nThe software can be compiled and installed from source using included *distutils* setup script. Python 3.x, PyOpenGL, PySide, numpy and Open Inventor / Coin are required on the target system. The setup script is pre-configured for Coin on Windows and OS X. Adaptations to the following variables defined in setup.py might be necessary for other configurations.\r\n```\r\n# Open Inventor paths and libraries:\r\noivincpath = ''\r\noivlibpath = ''\r\noivlib = []\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo compile and install PyInventor call:\r\n```\r\npython setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Windows (64 bit)\r\nAlternatively to installing the module from source, there is also a binary [installation package](dist/PyInventor-1.0.win-amd64-py3.4.exe) available for Windows. The prerequisites and of course PyInventor itself can be installed with the following downloadable packages:\r\n- [Python 3.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-341/)\r\n- [Scipy Stack](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy-stack)\r\n- [PyOpenGL](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyopengl)\r\n- [PyInventor](dist/PyInventor-1.0.win-amd64-py3.4.exe)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using the Module\r\nFor an overview on how to use it please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/TheHubbit/PyInventor/wiki) where you can find a [getting started guide](https://github.com/TheHubbit/PyInventor/wiki/Using-PyInventor) and [examples](https://github.com/TheHubbit/PyInventor/wiki/PyInventor-Examples).\r\n\r\n![Preview](images/PyInventorExamples.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nThe documentation for all classes, functions and data used to interface with the Open Inventor toolkit is built into the library and therefore available in the help system of the *IPython* shell and most development environments. It can also be viewed with the *pydoc* tool and is accessible as online [class reference](man/PyInventor.html).\r\n\r\nThe class documentation for the 3D graphics toolkit itself can be found [here](http://coin3d.bitbucket.org/Coin/index.html).\r\n\r\n## Scene Graph Editor\r\nThe included Scene Graph Editor application can render scene graph files (Inventor, VRML, 3D Studio) and their structure in a tree view. It furthermore allows adding, removing or rearranging nodes within the scene graph as well as editing of field values, immediately making those changes visible in the viewport.\r\n\r\nTo run the editor, simply type the following command:\r\n```\r\npython -m PyInventor\r\n```\r\nExtension libraries that provide additional scene objects can be loaded by defining the *IV_LIBS* environment variable, which can contain dynamically loadable libraries separated by a semicolon. Those libraries need to define a function called *initAllClasses()* that register all scene objects in the global database.\r\n\r\n![Scene Graph Editor](images/SceneGraphEditor.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\nPyInventor is distributed under the BSD 3-Clause License.
